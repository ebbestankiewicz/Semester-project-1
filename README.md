## Overview

This project was my Semester Project 1 in the Noroff Frontend Programme. The Community Science Museum site provides:

- A welcoming **Home** page with hero imagery, museum highlights, and navigation.  
- A **Contact** page displaying address, phone, opening hours, and a contact form with validation.  
- A **Contribution** page that explains how visitors can donate or volunteer to support the museum.  
- An **Exhibitions** page with details on upcoming events and current exhibits.  
- A **Privacy Policy** page outlining data practices.  
- A **Terms & Conditions** page explaining visitor responsibilities and disclaimers.  

The design uses a vibrant but not childish color palette, appealing to ages 7â€“15 as well as adults.
